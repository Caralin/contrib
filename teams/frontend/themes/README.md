# DDI Contrib Theme Purpose

* Develop of a team with diversity in mind from the beginning
* Creation of a contribution that would be highly visible on Drupal.org
* A way to mentor

Teams with diverse members make better products for more people. The dearth of diverse teams in tech, and in Drupal in particular, signals a culture where people of many different identities and backgrounds do not feel included in participating. By deliberately recruiting teams from spaces where people of diverse backgrounds collaborate, the DDI Contrib team is better positioned to have diversity in mind from the outset.

Smaller teams are better able to build an inclusive culture from the ground up, and enable one-on-one mentoring. A deliberately created initiative like the DDI Contrib Team is more likely to be visible and accomplish goals than perhaps impromptu teams or individual efforts.

Itâ€™s important to note that diversity *should* be intersectional, and consider race, gender, sexuality, disability, economic status, nationality, ethnicity, faith background, and speciality in Drupal/web development.

# Structural decisions:

* To make a base theme that can be subthemed; or a theme that is intended to be usable and customizable out of the box; or one of each!
 * Build a base theme *and* several use-case specific subthemes with high levels of individual customization?
* WCAG AA or higher
* Build tools: Gulp, etc
* Whether to use a framework such as Bootstrap, Foundation, whatever
 * CSS Grid Support vs Framework
* Should We Develop a Component Based Theme?
 * Components Allows for people to focus on different components of the theme which might be easier for a community built theme
* Target use cases
 * Brochure / Business Site
 * One Page Theme
 * Blog
 * Store
 * Portfolio
* Browser support (e.g. IE 11+?)
 * Require Flexbox / Grid support?
